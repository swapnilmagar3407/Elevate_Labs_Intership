Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

Objective:
To capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark.

Environment:
- OS: Kali Linux
- Tool: Wireshark (Latest version from apt repository)

Protocols Identified:
1. HTTP (Port 80) - Hypertext Transfer Protocol used for unencrypted web communication.
2. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol that provides reliable, ordered delivery of data between applications.
3. DNS (Port 53) - Domain Name System protocol used for translating domain names into IP addresses.

Summary of Findings:
- Captured packets while visiting websites and performing network queries.
- Example:
  1. HTTP Packet: Source IP 192.168.1.10 → Destination IP 93.184.216.34, Protocol: HTTP, Length: 512 bytes
  2. TCP Packet: Source IP 192.168.1.10 → Destination IP 142.250.183.110, Protocol: TCP, Length: 60 bytes
  3. DNS Query: Source IP 192.168.1.10 → Destination IP 8.8.8.8, Protocol: DNS, Length: 74 bytes

Conclusion:
This exercise improved understanding of live packet capturing, protocol filtering, and basic network traffic analysis.
